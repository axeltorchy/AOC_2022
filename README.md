# AOC_2022

This year, I am participating in the Advent of Code 2022 competition.
However, since my sleeping schedule does not allow me to start working on the
new puzzle as soon as it is released, I am not going to compete with other
participants. Neither am I hoping to appear in any kind of leaderboard :-)

My solutions are not necessarily optimal, although I might try not to hasten
towards the most naive solution.
I may come back to some of the problems in the future to propose a better (i.e.
more efficient or clean) solution.

Everything is free to use, reuse, distribute, and I am also open to comments
and suggestions regarding my solutions. I would be more than happy to discuss
the drawbacks of my implementations and to learn how to do better code!


Cheers
